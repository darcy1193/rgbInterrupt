`make flash` compiles and flashes `powerModes.c`

name and pinout in comments - thank you!

all modes operate correctly

mode 0 (no light on powerup/reset) should be avoided, even though it does not repeat. no points off for this, but it _is_ out of spec.

both green and blue are running on timer/signal. green on timer/interrupt would not require P1SEL and would require a TIMER0_A0_VECTOR interrupt handler.

good, thorough, fairly neat comments (though you should comment interrupt handlers as well).
